# Rock, paper, scissors, lizard, Spock!

This project is based on the popular TV show 'The Big Bang Theory', the game is an expansion of the classic 'Rock, paper, scissors', adding two new characters, the lizard and Spock, so you have way more possibilities against your opponents.

## How the game works?

This particular app works with five buttons to choose from (each one of the characters), you can select only one of them per turn and you will be playing against the computer during the next five rounds of each game, but you can restart the game at any point you want. You can see your score and the computer's, so you keep track of the wins in each round.

This app also works as a nice way to get to know what the rules of the game are, which can be confusing at times, considering all of the outcomes that exist between each character.

## How was it made?
This game was made with JavaScript for the logic and HTML/CSS for the interface of the page.
